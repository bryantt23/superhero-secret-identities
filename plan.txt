I created rudimentary models
Not sure how I am going to use the models
I think a user will create a post which is made up of a secret and user

First I am just going to get the user to 
register
log in
log out

I will check if they can see a message only if they are logged in
This page will just say hidden if logged out, shown if logged in

After I get this work I will resume my brainstorming here
1018pm

toggle is isMember

add dummy posts and render to the index
with author, hero, & identity
if logged out only show superhero name and no author

if logged in and member can see hero, secret identity, and author
admin can delete

1/14/21
133am

create add secret form
have that add to the array

after i get this working for both users then 
find out how to have each message have an id

after that create the delete button for each message
get the delete button to work by using the id
after this functionality will be complete

clean up
delete unneeded code
try to get views into view folder

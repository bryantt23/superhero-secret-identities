I created rudimentary models
Not sure how I am going to use the models
I think a user will create a post which is made up of a secret and user

First I am just going to get the user to 
register
log in
log out

I will check if they can see a message only if they are logged in
This page will just say hidden if logged out, shown if logged in

After I get this work I will resume my brainstorming here
1018pm
